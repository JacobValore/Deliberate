# Deliberate
Deliberate is a website blocking Chrome extension to help with impulse control.

Rather than fully blocking a website, Deliberate allows you to easily unblock a site by typing in the reason you want to use it and how long you plan on using the site. This brings the decision to access an addictive website into the logic processing part of the brain, rather than the muscle memory part that is activated when you get bored.

This extension is still a work in progress. A full version with an integrated desktop application is the major goal. Statistics tracking is planned and data privacy is a top priority. Once the primary Windows application and Chrome extension development is completed, work will transition to integrating with Mac and Linux operating systems as well as extensions for other browsers, including Firefox, Safari, and Edge. There is also a stretch goal to integrate these applications with an Android and iPhone app.

Deliberate is coded in JavaScript using Chrome Extensions Manifest V3. The desktop application is being coded in JavaScript using Electron. This repository is only for nearly finished pieces of the project, so currently it only includes the extension files.
